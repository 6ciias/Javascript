<!-- Created an HTML file with a title and a structure for the web page.
Styled the buttons and defined different button classes for red and green colors.
Added two buttons, one labeled "Red" and the other labeled "Green", within separate div containers.
Linked a JavaScript file to the HTML file to handle button clicks.

In script.js:

Declared variables to store references to the red and green buttons.
Added event listeners to the buttons, which listen for click events.
When the red button is clicked, a function is called that changes the background color of the page to red.
Similarly, when the green button is clicked, a function is called that changes the background color of the page to green.
