// Here I created several different arrays.... One for their first and last name, and their age. 
// After I created 3 More variables where I can select from the arrays and define them as students.
// I then used [1] as it highlights the 2nd array from the each of the variables.

// Once I finished that I did console log and made the string "hello my name is *add first name variable* 
// *add last name variable, string continues "and I'm" *add age variable. "years old"
